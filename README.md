# Customer Acquisition & Retention through Data Mining
GOAL: To help Banks and other institutions understand their customers and their individual usage patters to recommend/ cross-sell other products and services, using Association Rule Mining or otherwise known as Market Basket Analysis.

## INTRODUCTION
Data Mining helps in the process of optimized targeting, making it easier for banks to instantly identify the high-value customer segments most likely to respond. The customer base can further expand by acquiring the right type of customer. Based on a report, it was seen the banks that adopted data & analytics had an increase of about 10%  in new customer opportunities over a year. <br>

Also data mining helps banks and financial institutions retain their customers. It: <br>

1. Identifies the customers most likely to defect before they end their relationship.
2. Keeps the right customers longer.
3. Predicts which actions will earn their loyalty.
4. Discovers the churn patterns and develop profiles of users who have left, 
5. Get an insight of why they left and discover strategies to keep them satisfied.

Customer retention is another area where banks need to focus more today in order to reduce customer sapping. Loyal customers need to be rewarded and customer attrition needs to be minimized. Sometimes it gets too late to retain a customer because they tend to have a large customer base and hence lose track of them. It’s easy to look out for a new customer but the old ones are always valuable. Data Mining helps identify which customers are willing to switch to any other bank and the reason behind their decision. It examines customer’s service performance, spending, past service and other behavior patterns to predict the likelihood of a customer wanting to stop its services anytime in the near future.

### Association Rule Mining/ Market Basket Analysis/ Affinity Analysis

Unsupervised learning is all about pattern discovery. It is a type of machine learning where the main focus is to find regularly occurring patterns in a group of data. Usually these patterns are hidden or buried deep in the data and are undetected. This type of machine learning needs no supervision as the input data has no references or labels for the algorithm to learn, enabling it to learn on its own without any bias, gather inferences and find out patterns. One such technique is ssociation rule mining. <br>

Affinity analysis is a data analysis and data mining technique that discovers co-occurrence relationships among activities performed by specific individuals or groups. In general, this can be applied to any process where agents can be uniquely identified and information about their activities can be recorded. It is one of the key techniques used by large organizations to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows companies to identify relationships between the items that people buy.
